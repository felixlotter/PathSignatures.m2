    Description
        Text
            This method allows to create a monomial in a free associative algebra $R$. It follows the same 
            convention of @TO wordFormat@. Let $Lt_1,\dots, Lt_d$ be the generators of $R$, then an array of 
            integers $[i_1,\dots, i_k]$ such that $0<i_l<d+1, \forall 1\leq l\leq k$ yields the element 
            $$Lt_{i_1} Lt_{i_2}\cdot\dots\cdot Lt_{i_{k-1}} Lt_{i_k}$$
            of $R$.
        Example
            d = 5;
            R = wordAlgebra(d); -- create a free associative algebra over Lt_1,..., Lt_d
            a = new Array from for i from 1 to d list i; -- The array [1,...,d]
            f = a_R  -- The word associated to a

    Description
        Text
            A more readable display of tensors can be obtained through the following convention. Let $Lt_1,\dots, Lt_d$ be the generators of $R$, then an array of 
            integers $[i_1,\dots, i_k]$ such that $0<i_l<d+1, \forall 1\leq l\leq k$ yields the decomposable tensor
            $$Lt_{i_1} Lt_{i_2}\cdot\dots\cdot Lt_{i_{k-1}} Lt_{i_k}$$
            of $R$. This notation can then be extended linearly to any tensor.
        Example
            R = wordAlgebra(2);
            f = ([1,2]_R ** [1,2]_R) -- shuffle product of Lt_1*Lt_1 with itself displayed as a non commutative polynomial

    Description
        Text
            A polynomial path is a map $[0,1] \to \mathbb R^d$ whose coordinate functions are given by polynomials. A piecewise polynomial path is a concatenation of polynomial paths.
        Text
            To create a polynomial path, use @TO polyPath@, which takes a list of polynomials as input. These can be given as elements of a commutative polynomial ring with one generator or directly in @TO2 {"Macaulay2Doc :: listForm", "listForm"}@.
        Example
            R = QQ[t];
            X = polyPath({t,2*t^2,3*t^3})
            Y = polyPath({{({1},1)},{({2},2)},{({3},3)}})
        Text
            While the polynomials must be chosen from a polynomial ring with one generator, the coefficient ring of the polynomials can be chosen arbitrarily.
        Example
            R = QQ[a][t]; --QQ[a,t] will not work!
            X = polyPath({t,2*a*t^2,3*a^2*t^3})
        Text
            An important special case of polynomial paths are linear paths. These can be constructed directly from their increment using @TO linPath@.
        Example
            Y = linPath({2,3,4})
        Text
            Paths can be concatenated using @TO (symbol **, Path, Path)@. This concatenation is formal: the new Path object encodes the polynomial pieces and their order, but no parametrization is chosen. The concatenation @TO (symbol **, Path, Path)@ will automatically select a bigger coefficient ring for all polynomial pieces if an obvious choice is available.
        Example
            Z = X ** Y
        Text
            A piecewise linear path can be constructed directly from the increments of its segments using @TO pwLinPath@.
        Example
            A = matrix {{1,2,3},{2,3,4},{4,5,6}};
            W = pwLinPath(A)
        Text
            To read out the ambient dimension of a path, use @TO (getDimension, Path)@ or @TO (dim, Path)@. To get the pieces of the path in @TO2 {"Macaulay2Doc :: listForm", "listForm"}@ use @TO (getPieces, Path)@. To get the coefficient ring of the coordinate polynomials, use @TO (getCoefficientRing, Path)@ or @TO (coefficientRing, Path)@. Finally, @TO (getNumberOfPieces, Path)@ returns the number of pieces of the path.
        Example
            getDimension(Z) --The ambient dimension of the path
            getPieces(Z) --The polynomial pieces of the path, in listForm
            getCoefficientRing(Z) -- The coefficient ring of the polynomial components of the path
            getNumberOfPieces(Z) -- The number of polynomial pieces of the path
        Text
            To extract the pieces of a concatenated path one can use @TO (symbol _, Path, ZZ)@, @TO (symbol _, Path, List)@ and @TO (symbol _, Path, Sequence)@.
        Example
            Z_0
            Z2 = Z^2
            Z2_{0,-1}
        Text
            When considering the set of paths modulo tree-like equivalence, concatenation turns it into a groupoid. Use @TO (symbol ^, Path, ZZ)@ to compute powers and the inverse of a path in this groupoid. Note that the inverse of a path is just given by reversing its parametrization.
        Example
            X^4
            X^(-1)

    Description
        Text
            This computes the image of g through the map $M_p$ described in Theorem 1 and Theorem 7 of @HREF("#ref1","[1]")@. Its importance is evidenced by
            Theorem 2 of the same paper: 
        Text
            Let $X:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ be a piecewise continuously differentiable path
            with $X(0) = 0$ and let $p : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a polynomial map with $p(0) = 0$. Then, for
            all $w ∈ T(\mathbb{R}^m)$ one has $$  \sigma(p(X)) = M_p^*(\sigma(X))$$
            (where $\sigma(X)$ is the signature of $X$ and $M_p^*$ is the dual map of $M_p$).
        Text 
            As a use example, we verify this in a particular case. First we define a transformation of affine spaces and create the word algebra
            where our tensors live
        Example
            S = QQ[x,y]; 
            p = {x^2,x*y,y^2} -- A map of affine spaces, the degree 2 Veronese morphism R^2 -> R^3

            wA2 = wordAlgebra(2); -- signatures of paths in dimension 2 
            wA3 = wordAlgebra(3); -- signatures of paths in dimension 3
        Text
            Then we define a path in the domain space and explicitly compute its image under the polynomial map above:
        Example
            R = QQ[t];
            X = polyPath({t,t^2}) -- A path in 2 dimensional space
            PP = apply(p, q -> sub(q, {x=>t, y=>t^2})); 
            Y = polyPath(PP) -- the transformed path in 3 dimensional space
        Text
            Finally we compute the signature of the transformed path along the @TO sgnVolTensor@ tensor of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and verify the formula in Theorem 2 above:
        Example
            vol = sgnVolTensor(wA3); vol // wordFormat -- consider the signed volume in R^3 and display it in word format
            adw = adjointWord(vol, wA2, p); adw // wordFormat -- we compute its image through the induced homomorphism on algebras
            sig(Y, vol)  -- the signed volume of the transformed path
            sig(X, adw)  -- is given by evaluating at adw for the original path.

    Description
        Text
            We start with the mathematical definition of this operation, based on @HREF("#ref1","[1]")@. 
            Consider $T(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the free algebra on the symbols $1,\dots, d$. Denote 
            by $\bullet$ its concatenation product and by $e$ the neutral element with respect to the concatenation (the empty word). The shuffle product of two words is defined 
            recursively as follows. Let $w, w_1, w_2$ be three words and $a, b$ bet two letters, i.e.
            $w, w_1, w_2\in T(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $a,b\in \{1,\dots, d\}$. Then the shuffle product $\char"29E2$ is defined to be
            $$ e \char"29E2 w := w =: w\char"29E2 e$$
            and 
            $$(w_1\bullet a) \char"29E2 (w_2\bullet b) = (w_1 \char"29E2 (w_2\bullet b))\bullet a + ((w_1\bullet a)\char"29E2 w_2)\bullet b$$
        Text
            The easiest way to compute a shuffle product is through @TO (symbol **, NCRingElement, NCRingElement)@ which is equivalent to @TO (shuffle, NCRingElement, NCRingElement)@:
        Example

        create a free algebra over a given alphabet
    Description
        Text
            In this package, tensors are represented as elements of free associative algebras, using the package @TO2 {"NCAlgebra :: NCAlgebra", "NCAlgebra"}@.
            More precisely, the free associative algebra on the alphabet $\{\texttt 1,...,\texttt d\}$ is isomorphic to the tensor algebra $T(\mathbb R^d)$ via the algebra homomorphism induced by $\texttt i \mapsto e_i$. This allows us to interpret tensors as non-commutative polynomials, or equivalently, linear combinations of words.
            Given an alphabet $l$, the free associative algebra over it can be obtained by using @TO wordAlgebra@, where the letter corresponding to $x \in l$ is represented by $\texttt{Lt}_x$.
        Example
            d = 5;
            l1 = {getSymbol "a", getSymbol "b", getSymbol "c"};
            A = wordAlgebra(l1)
            gens A

            l2 = toList(1..d);
            B = wordAlgebra(l2)
            gens B
        Text
            The algebra B in the example can also be directly obtained for a given d using @TO (wordAlgebra, ZZ)@:
        Example
            B = wordAlgebra(d);
            gens B
        Text
            By default, @TO wordAlgebra@ creates a non-commutative algebra over @TO2{"Macaulay2Doc :: QQ", "QQ"}@. The coefficient ring can be changed via the CoefficientRing option:
        Example
            coefficientRing B
            C = wordAlgebra(d, CoefficientRing => CC)
            coefficientRing C
        Text
            An element of the algebra can be obtained by using the generator symbols, or (more conveniently) by using word notation, see @TO (symbol _, Array, NCPolynomialRing)@:
        Example
            d = 5;
            R = wordAlgebra(d); -- create a free associative algebra over two letters Lt_1, Lt_2
            f = 2 * [1,d]_R - [2,d]_R  -- [i_1,...,i_k]_R defines a word.
            f === 2 * Lt_1 * Lt_d - Lt_2 * Lt_d
        Text
            Note that for two words (equivalently, monomials) $\texttt{w}$ and $\texttt{v}$, $\texttt{w} * \texttt{v}$ is the concatenation.
        Text
            To display a non-commutative polynomial in word notation, one can use @TO wordFormat@ or @TO wordString@:
        Example
            f^3 // wordFormat
            f^3 // wordString
        Text
            There are more interesting algebraic structures on non-associative algebras; of particular importance in the context of path signatures is the shuffle product and the half-shuffle product:
        Example
            a = [1]_R ** [2]_R; wordFormat a -- the shuffle product
            b = [1,2]_R ** [3,4]_R; wordFormat b
            c = [1]_R >> [2,3]_R; wordFormat c -- the half-shuffle product
        Text
            See @TO (symbol **, NCRingElement, NCRingElement)@ and @TO (symbol >>, NCRingElement, NCRingElement)@ for more information on the shuffle and half-shuffle product.

    Description
        Text
            We start with the mathematical definition, based on @HREF("#ref1","[1]")@ (where the operation is called {\em right half-shuffle}). Let 
            $T^{\geq 1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ be the vector space spanned by the non empty words on $d$ letters. Then the half shuffle $>>$ is defined 
            recursively to be $$ w >> i := wi$$ for $w$ a word and $i$ a letter and $$ w >> vi := (w >> v + v >> w)\bullet i$$ for $w, v$ words 
            and $i$ a letter, where $\bullet$ is the concatenation product on words. 
        Text
            As stated in the reference, the @TO shuffle@ on non empty words can be seen as a symmetrization of the half-shuffle. As a usage example, we verify this in a particular instance.
        Example
            R = wordAlgebra(3);
            w = [1]_R
            v = [1,2,3]_R
            s = w ** v --shuffle product of w, v
            hsSymm = (w >> v) + (v >> w)--half-shuffle product symmetrization of w, v
            s == hsSymm

    Description
        Text
            A word $l$ on the alphabet $\{1,\dots, d\}$ is a {\em Lyndon word} if it is strictly smaller, in lexicographic order, than all of its rotations.
            To any Lyndon word we can associate an iterated Lie bracketing $b(l)\in T(\mathbb{R}^d)$ defined iteratively as follows. If $l$ is a letter $i\in \{1,\dots, d\}$
            we simply define $$ b(i) := e_i$$
            where as ever $e_i$ is the $i-th$ vector in the canonical basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. For the length of $l$ greater than 1 we define $$
            b(I) := [b(I_1), b(I_2)]$$
            where $I_1, I_2$ are such that their concatenation $I_1 I_2$ is $I$ and $I_2$ is the longest Lyndon word appearing as a proper right factor 
            of $I$. 
        Text
            This method computes $b(l)$ for a given Lyndon word. To illustrate its usage, we replicate Example 4.9 of the reference paper.
        Example
            R = wordAlgebra(2);
            lieBasis([1,1,1,2], R) == [1,1,1,2]_R - 3 * [1,1,2,1]_R + 3 * [1,2,1,1]_R - [2,1,1,1]_R
            lieBasis([1,1,2,2], R) == [1,1,2,2]_R - 2 * [1,2,1,2]_R + 2 * [2,1,2,1]_R - [2,2,1,1]_R
            lieBasis([1,2,2,2], R) == [1,2,2,2]_R - 3 * [2,1,2,2]_R + 3 * [2,2,1,2]_R - [2,2,2,1]_R

        Text
            The polynomial is represented as in @TO2 {"Macaulay2Doc::standardForm","standard form"}@, with the variable index replaced by the respective Lyndon word. One easily obtains an actual polynomial from this:
        Example
            var = new Array from apply(lyndonWords(3,3), i->x_i)
            R = QQ var;
            pol = sum(pairs f, (term,coef) -> coef * product(pairs term, (word,ex)-> x_word^ex))
        Text
            Indeed, we check:
        Example
            ([1]_A3**[2]_A3**[3]_A3 - [1]_A3**[2,3]_A3 - [1,2]_A3**[3]_A3 + [1,2,3]_A3) // wordFormat

            In general, one can "shuffle out" a polynomial like $\texttt{pol}$ in two steps as follows:

    Description
        Text
            The inner product of two words $\mathtt{w}$ and $\mathtt{v}$ in a free associative algebra is defined as $1$ if $\mathtt{w} = \mathtt{v}$ and $0$ otherwise. This extends bilinearly to an inner product on the whole associative algebra.
        Text
            The inner product can be used to access the coefficient of a tensor over a single word.
        Example
            R = wordAlgebra(3);

            where the sum is taken over all permutations of ${1, \dots, d}$. Under the isomorphism $\mathbb R \langle \mathtt{1}, \dots, \mathtt{d} \rangle \to T(\mathbb{R}^d), \ \mathtt{i} \mapsto e_i^*$ it corresponds to the determinant $e_1^* \wedge \dots \wedge e_d^*$.
        Text
            This method computes the signed volume tensor of the given @TO NCPolynomialRing@. The output is in the same ring.
        Example
            d = 3;
            R = wordAlgebra(d)
            sgnVolTensor(R) // wordFormat
        Text
            The paper @HREF("#ref1","[1]")@ explores under what conditions the value of the signature at the signed volume tensor computes the volume of the convex hull of a path. One instance where this is true is the case of canonical axis paths (see @TO CAxisTensor@).
            For example, for $\mathtt{d}=3$ the convex hull of the canonical axis path in $\mathbb{R}^{\mathtt{d}}$ is a tetrahedron, whose volume is $\frac{1}{6}$. We verify this.
        Example
            X = linPath({1,0,0})**linPath({0,1,0})**linPath({0,0,1})
            R = wordAlgebra(3) -- where the signature of X lives
            v = sgnVolTensor(R); 
            sig(X, v) -- computes the signature of X at the signed volume tensor

            $k[b_w \ | \ w\in I] \to A$ that maps $b_\mathtt{w}$ to $a_\mathtt{w}$. Here $k$ is the $\texttt{baseRing}$ of $A$. If $\texttt{CoefficientRing}$ is provided, it replaces $k$. If $\texttt{VarWordTable}$ is provided, the map above is precomposed with the morphism induced by the assignments in the hash table.

        compute the signature of a piecewise polynomial path.
    Description
        Text
            Given a @TO Path@ $X(t):[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, its signature is the linear form $\sigma: T((\mathbb{R}^d)^*)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on the tensor algebra of the dual of 
            $\mathbb{R}^d$, whose image on a decomposable tensor $\alpha_1\otimes \dots\otimes \alpha_k$ is the iterated integral $$
            \alpha_1\otimes \dots\otimes \alpha_k\overset{\sigma}{\mapsto} \int_0^1\int_0^{t_k}\dots\int_0^{t_2}\partial(\alpha_1 X)\dots \partial (\alpha_k X) d t_1\dots dt_k.
            $$
            This form does not depend on the parametrization of $X$.
            In this package, we identify $T((\mathbb{R}^d)^*)$ with the free associative algebra over the alphabet $\{\texttt{1},\dots,\texttt{d}\}$ via $\texttt{i} \mapsto e_i^*$ where $e_1^*, \dots, e_d^*$ is the dual of the canonical basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. See also @TO wordAlgebra@.
        Example
            d = 4;
            R = QQ[t];
            X = polyPath(for i from 1 to d list t^i) -- the moment path in dimension d
            A = wordAlgebra(d) -- create the free associative algebra over d letters
            w = (new Array from (1..d))_A -- the word 1..d
        Text
            In the example above, the word $\texttt{w}$ corresponds to the simple tensor $e_1^*\otimes\dots  \otimes e_d^*$.
            The signature of $X$ on this word can be computed using @TO (sig, Path, NCRingElement)@.
        Example 
            sig(X, w)
            sig(X,[1]_A)
            sig(X,[2,3]_A)
        Text
            One can also compute the {\em k-th level} signature tensor for $k\in \mathbb{N}$ by using @TO (sig, Path, ZZ)@. This returns the tensor as a non-commutative polynomial in symbols Lt_1, ..., Lt_d.
        Example
            T = sig(X, 2)
            T // wordFormat
        Text
            Note however that neither the symbols nor the ring of this polynomial are made available to the user, in particular they can not be added or multiplied. To obtain the tensor as a NCPolynomial in a given NCRing, use @TO (sig, Path, ZZ,  NCRing)@ instead. The following example demonstrates Chen's identity:
        Example
            T = 1 + sig(X, 1, A) + sig(X, 2, A);
            S = T * T;
            Ma = matrix (S@2) -- the second component of S as a matrix
            Y = X ** X -- X concatenated with itself
            Mb = matrix (sig(Y, 2, A)@2) -- the signature matrix of Y
            (Ma == Mb)

            The {\em canonical axis path} in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is the path from $(0, \dots, 0)$ to $(1, \dots, 1)$ given by $d$ linear steps 
            in the unit directions $e_1, \dots, e_d$, in this order. The $k$-th level signature tensor of such a path has a combinatorial closed-form description (see the reference below) and can be obtained as follows:
        Example
            d = 2;
            k = 3;
            R = wordAlgebra(d);

        Text
            To expand on the example, we verify that the result agrees with the one obtained from @TO sig@.
            Notice that the matrix of increments for the canonical axis path in dimension $d$ is 
            the $d \times d$ identity matrix.
        Example
            M = id_(QQ^d); -- identity matrix
